## Welcome!

This workshop will introduce you to **text as data** and **text analyis**, particularly using the [tidytext](https://juliasilge.github.io/tidytext/) R package.


# 1. Follow along with slides for today

# 2. Interactive lesson

Today we'll be spending time with Julia Silge's fantastic learnr lesson, [Text mining with tidy data principles](https://juliasilge.shinyapps.io/learntidytext/). 

We'll spend about half an hour working through the lesson, but I encourage you to keep going after the session.
