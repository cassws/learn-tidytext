## Welcome!

This workshop will introduce you to **text as data** and **text analyis**, particularly using the [tidytext](https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext) R package.


# 1. Follow along with slides for today

[Here are today's slides (still-in-progress!)](slides/workshop-slides.html)


Two key references for our work today:
1. [Introduction to tidytext vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/vignettes/tidytext.html)
2. [Text Mining with R book](https://www.tidytextmining.com/)

# 2. Interactive lesson

Today we'll be spending time with Julia Silge's fantastic learnr lesson, [Text mining with tidy data principles](https://juliasilge.shinyapps.io/learntidytext/). 

We'll spend about half an hour working through the lesson, but I encourage you to keep going after the session.
