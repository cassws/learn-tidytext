# "Desperately Need a Car” as text + data process


1. Create a dataframe from a website (web scraping)

2. Split open text into sequence of words or tokens (tokenization)

3. Count words or phrases (n-grams)

4. Analyzing connections based on proximity of words/phrases (collocation)

# Why tidy?

"'Happy families are all alike; every
unhappy family is unhappy in its own
way
Leo Tolstoy'

Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way." (2014, Wickham, "Tidy Data")

A **token** in text mining is a meaningful unit of analysis

"For tidy text mining, the **token** that is stored in each row is most often a single word, but can also be an n-gram, sentence, or paragraph."
