# Data science is all about creative problem solving

Data problems are like:

- Cooking a recipe with a half-empty pantry
- Getting a couch up a narrow staircase
- Sketching a bird you can't quite see

There's an "ideal" problem space and the actual problem space. 

Or a mixture of **method** and **mess**.

# ELIZA

"ELIZA is an early natural language processing computer program created from 1964 to 1966 at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum.

..Eliza simulated conversation by using a "pattern matching" and substitution methodology that gave users an illusion of understanding on the part of the program.."

# “Desperately Need a Car”: Analyzing Crowdfunding Campaigns for Car Purchases and Repairs on Gofundme.com

- First, how do campaigners on GoFundMe describe their need for personal
vehicles? 
- Second, what precipitating events led them to seek crowdfunding for a car purchase or
repair? 
- Third, what are broader contexts for these requests for financial assistance?

"For tidy text mining, the **token** that is stored in each row is most often a single word, but can also be an n-gram, sentence, or paragraph. In the tidytext package, we provide functionality to tokenize by commonly used units of text like these and convert to a one-term-per-row format."

Hands-on for today!

Pay attention to **problem solving recipes**. How do you learn about research questions with text here?
